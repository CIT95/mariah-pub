## Motivation Everyday
The goal was to have an input of the mood you felt the day of and then it would generate a positive message after the input. I also had the forcast of the day inputed to provide a self development activity. This was a learning experience for me because I am still trying to get the hang of this. I am hoping it meets the requiremnents needed, but I would love feed back especially how to seperate ifs and elifs because they didn't work for me as I seen them in the learning videos. I had fun making this code I hope you enjoy it.
