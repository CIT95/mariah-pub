## Dev work
It would be interesting to develop the begining of an app. I am not sure how far ahead we would have to be in class for that, but being able to learn the concepts of how to create one would be nice. Apps are interesting because a lot of apps are created, but some end up having a lot of bug issues. I would like to understand what these issues could be. Would it be because the code isn't written well or what other reasons could apps crash? I understand some apps crash because of viruses but how do virus take over the code? Maybe, its just me but definitely would like to learn more about apps.
